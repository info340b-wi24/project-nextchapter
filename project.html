    <h1>Next Chapter: Book Sharing Platform</h1>

    <h2>Problem Description</h2>
    <p>
        "Next Chapter" is a web app aimed at tackling the problem of 
        book accessibility and overconsumption in reading. The core 
        idea is to create a platform where people can swap, give away, 
        or sell books, fostering a community-driven approach. This concept 
        addresses several key issues: the inaccessibility of books for 
        certain demographics, and the environmental impact of overconsumption.
    
        Unlike many existing platforms, "Next Chapter" would not just be a place to buy and sell books, but also to swap and give them away. This creates a more sustainable lifecycle for books.
    
        The platform would include features like a virtual bookshelf for users to showcase their collection, a search and filter system to find specific books, and a system for libraries to request or offer books.</p>
