    <h2>Problem Description</h2>
    <p>
        "Next Chapter" is a web app aimed at tackling the problem of 
        book accessibility and overconsumption in reading. The core 
        idea is to create a platform where people can swap, give away, 
        or sell books, fostering a community-driven approach. This concept 
        addresses several key issues: the inaccessibility of books for 
        certain demographics, and the environmental impact of overconsumption.</p>
