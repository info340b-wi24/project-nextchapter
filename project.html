    <h1>Next Chapter: Book Sharing Platform</h1>
   </header>

   <section>
    <h2>Problem Description</h2>
    <p>
        "Next Chapter" is a web app aimed at tackling the problem of book accessibility and overconsumption in reading. The core idea is to create a platform where people can swap or give away fostering a community-driven approach. This concept addresses <strong>several key issues: the inaccessibility of books for certain demographics, and the environmental impact of overconsumption.</strong>
        Unlike many existing platforms, "Next Chapter" would be a place to swap and give them away. This creates a more sustainable lifecycle for books. The platform would include features like a virtual bookshelf for users to showcase their collection, and a search and filter system to find specific books. </p>

    <h2>Existing solutions and their limitations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Some platforms like <strong>Goodreads</strong> primarily focus on book tracking and recommendations, not on the physical exchange of books.</li>
            <li>Sites like <strong>BookMooch</strong> or <strong>PaperBackSwap</strong> do exist for book swapping, but they often lack a robust community interaction feature, real-time chat, and a comprehensive system for libraries.</li>
            <li><strong>Husky Swaps</strong>, a website used for swapping items among a university community, serves as inspiration but is limited in scope and functionality compared to the proposed <strong>"Next Chapter"</strong> platform.</li>
        </ul>
