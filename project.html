    <h1>Next Chapter: Book Sharing Platform</h1>
   </header>

   <section>
    <h2>Problem Description</h2>
    <p>
        "Next Chapter" is a web app aimed at tackling the problem of book accessibility and overconsumption in reading. The core idea is to create a platform where people can swap or give away books fostering a community-driven approach. This concept addresses <strong>several key issues: the inaccessibility of books for certain demographics, and the environmental impact of overconsumption.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike many existing platforms, "Next Chapter" would be a place to swap and give them away. This creates a more sustainable lifecycle for books. The platform would include features like a virtual bookshelf for users to showcase their collection, and a search and filter system to find specific books.

    <h2>Existing solutions and their limitations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Some platforms like <strong>Goodreads</strong> primarily focus on book tracking and recommendations, not on the physical exchange of books.</li>
            <li>Sites like <strong>BookMooch</strong> or <strong>PaperBackSwap</strong> do exist for book swapping, but they often lack a robust community interaction feature and a comprehensive system for libraries.</li>
