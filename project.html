    <h2>Problem Description</h2>
    <p>
        "Next Chapter" is a web app aimed at tackling the problem of book accessibility and overconsumption in reading. The core idea is to create a platform where people can swap or give away fostering a community-driven approach. This concept addresses several key issues: the inaccessibility of books for certain demographics, and the environmental impact of overconsumption. Unlike many existing platforms, "Next Chapter" would be a place to swap and give them away. This creates a more sustainable lifecycle for books. The platform would include features like a virtual bookshelf for users to showcase their collection, and a search and filter system to find specific books.
