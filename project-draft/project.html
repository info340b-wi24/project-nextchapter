        <h1>Next Chapter: Book Sharing Platform</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
            "Next Chapter" is a web app aimed at tackling the problem of book accessibility and overconsumption in reading. The core idea is to create a platform where people can swap or give away books, fostering a community-driven approach. This concept addresses <strong>several key issues: the inaccessibility of books for certain demographics, and the environmental impact of overconsumption.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike many existing platforms, "Next Chapter" would be a place to swap and give away books. This creates a more sustainable lifecycle for books. The platform would include features like a virtual bookshelf for users to showcase their collection and a search and filter system to find specific books.

        <h2>Existing solutions and their limitations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Some platforms like <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a></strong> primarily focus on book tracking and recommendations, not on the physical exchange of books.</li>
            <li>Sites like <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://bookmooch.com/">BookMooch</a></strong> or <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.paperbackswap.com/index.php">PaperBackSwap</a></strong> do exist for book swapping, but they often lack a robust community interaction feature and a comprehensive system for libraries.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <h3>Users of the Application</h3>
        <p>
            The primary users of this application are those who love books and are seeking sustainable ways to access a wide range of them. This may include individuals who are book lovers interested in discovering new books, book collectors looking for new genres, series, and unique books, and individuals who want to start reading to enhance their literacy.
            Our application is expected to have a positive impact on minority groups. We hope that with a diverse user base, there will be a broad range of literature reflecting different authors, genres, and perspectives. Additionally, we aim to include accessibility features to ensure that our users have a positive experience navigating the app. Overall, our app aims to foster a sense of community among all types of users.
        </p>
        <h3>Interactive Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Search and filtering for books:</strong> The application will have a search and filter feature that will allow users to sort through all existing book listings on the app.</li>
            <li><strong>Virtual bookshelf:</strong> User profiles will have a feature known as a virtual bookshelf. This includes books they want to swap, as well as a user-curated wishlist of books they would like. When creating a listing for a book, users must specify the title of the book, the author, if the book is hardcover or paperback, and a photo of the book so other users can see the condition before requesting to trade. This information will all be viewable upon selecting a listing.</li>
            <li><strong>Swap requests:</strong> Virtual bookshelves help support the main feature of the application: sending book swap requests to each other. Upon approval, users will be able to message each other and exchange contact information to meet up and physically trade the books.</li>
            <li><strong>Book personality quizzes:</strong> There will also be a quiz section on the application with book-related personality quizzes that users can take repeatedly for fun.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Information Viewed</h3>
        <p>
            Most of the information on the app will be user input as they would put in the books they want to swap or give away. But we will be filling up the app with a CSV file to have some data about books, CSV: <a target="_blank" href="https://gist.github.com/jaidevd/23aef12e9bf56c618c41">books.csv (github.com)</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Solving the Problem</h3>
        <p>
            Using this app could provide solutions related to book accessibility and overconsumption with trends. One of the problems is that with social media there has been an overproduction of books due to trends and these books are usually discarded after being read once. Our app would promote a sustainable book lifecycle through swapping and giveaways. Users would be able to exchange books for ones they haven't read and therefore minimize the production and environmental impact of production.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another problem is accessibility as books could become expensive, and it would be hard for certain demographics to access a wide range of books. This app would allow users who may be facing demographic or financial constraints to access books without facing any burdens. It may also allow people to have access to books they have never heard of and expand their knowledge of different cultures and perspectives.
